# Uptime Monitor API

### Description:
The Uptime Monitor API is a simple and lightweight application that allows users to monitor the availability of their specified links. It provides a RESTful interface to manage and track the uptime status of these links.

## Features:

Link Monitoring: Users can define the links they want to monitor for uptime or downtime.  
Uptime Status: The API periodically checks the provided links and determines their current status (up or down).  
RESTful API: The application follows REST architectural principles, allowing users to interact with it using standard HTTP methods.  
Token-Based Authentication: The API users token-based authentication to ensure secure access and protect user data.  
Raw Node.js Implementation: The project is implemented using pure Node.js without relying on any third-party modules or packages.
